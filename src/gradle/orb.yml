commands:

    description: |
      Run a set of steps with gradle dependencies cached.

      This command will first restore a cache of gradle dependencies, if one was
      saved by a previous build. The provided `steps` will then be executed, and
      if successful, then a fresh cache will be saved, if required.

      The contents of the `~/.gradle` directory is cached, which will substantially
      improve build times for projects with many dependencies.

      The cache-key is generated from any files named `build.gradle` that are
      present in the `working_directory`.
